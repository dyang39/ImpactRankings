# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the AI Research Impact Rankings?
The AI Research Impact Rankings is a comprehensive ranking system that evaluates universities and research institutions based on their research output and impact in three key AI research fields: Machine Learning, Computer Vision & Image Processing, and Natural Language Processing.

### How are the rankings calculated?
Rankings are calculated using a normalized harmonic mean approach that considers:
- **Raw Scores**: Direct research output metrics
- **Field-specific Scaling**: Each research field is evaluated independently
- **Geographic Distribution**: Global coverage with regional filtering
- **Faculty Contributions**: Individual researcher impact assessment

### What data sources are used?
The rankings are based on:
- Conference publications in top-tier venues
- Faculty research contributions
- University research output metrics
- Peer-reviewed academic papers

## Technical Questions

### How do I use the filtering system?
1. **Geographic Filters**: Use the region and country dropdowns to filter by location
2. **Research Fields**: Check/uncheck the field checkboxes to focus on specific research areas
3. **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific universities
4. **Faculty Details**: Click on university names to view detailed faculty information

### What do the top field badges mean?
The colored badges next to Impact Scores indicate:
- **ML Badge (Blue)**: Top performer in Machine Learning
- **Vision Badge (Green)**: Top performer in Computer Vision & Image Processing  
- **NLP Badge (Purple)**: Top performer in Natural Language Processing

These badges are based on absolute highest scores across all data, regardless of current filter selection.

### How are the faculty charts scaled?
Each research field's bar chart uses field-specific maximum scores for scaling, ensuring accurate visualization. This means:
- Each field scales to its own maximum value
- Charts accurately represent relative performance within each field
- Top performers are clearly visible with proper scaling

### Can I export the data?
Currently, the application is designed for interactive web viewing. Data export functionality may be added in future versions.

## Data Questions

### How often is the data updated?
Data updates depend on the source research publications and conference schedules. The current dataset represents a snapshot of research impact as of the data collection period.

### Why might some universities not appear in certain fields?
Universities may not appear in specific research fields if:
- They have no significant research output in that field
- Their research contributions don't meet the minimum threshold
- The data collection period didn't capture their relevant publications

### Are all universities included?
The ranking includes universities with significant research output in the three focus areas. Coverage is comprehensive but not exhaustive, focusing on institutions with measurable research impact.
